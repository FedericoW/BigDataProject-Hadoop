# BigDataProject-Hadoop

This project was composed of 2 programs that implemented Hadoop Streaming Framework and were able to run big amounts of data due to XSEDE. Each program consisted of 2 mappers and 2 reducers and used the Yelp dataset (Source:https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/version/4). Program 1 found the most popular buisness, while Program 2 found the highest rated buisness.
